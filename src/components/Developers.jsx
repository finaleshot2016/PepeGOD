Pepe God's goal is to help the poor chads in this world of crypto. By buybacking 2ETH and airdroping tokens.
<br /><br />
<b>So how can He help?</b><br />
By randomly Airdroping 3k $PEPE to the holders. (Worth 3ETH in 1M MC)<br /><br />

<b>How can we get airdrop?</b><br />
You are already eligible by holding 500-1k $PEPE. (1K above and 500 below is not eligible)<br /><br />

<b>What is the goal of this?</b><br />
It will pump the $PEPE holders, Whales will distribute their tokens to different wallets,<br /> if they want to win, therefore they will not dump their whole bag and destroy the chart.
